Hi,

A clean, multi-tenant customer portal with RBAC, tickets, contracts, and asset management — built a working version to show my approach:

**Built this for your project:** https://customer-portal-xi-one.vercel.app

The demo includes a full dashboard with filtering, 5 entity pages (tickets, projects, documents, contracts, assets), role-based navigation, and search across all modules. Built on Next.js + TypeScript with clean separation between data, components, and routes.

Recently shipped a similar multi-tenant SaaS (DealerHub) managing 187+ vehicles with role-based access across multiple dealership accounts.

Are you planning fixed RBAC roles (Admin/Viewer) or do teams need configurable permission sets per module?

The demo covers the core flow — want to discuss what the production version needs beyond this?
